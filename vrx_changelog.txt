All abilities can be upgraded to level 10 by any class, but if you upgrade something out of your class-specific abilities, you will receive a 50% penalty.

** BFG now only inflicts 50% damage to it's owner when they fire too close (since the BFG is like an energy rocket)
** Re-wrote knock weapon code to work more efficiently, with slightly reduced effectiveness. You have to fire at a player's weapon to have it knock (the general area anyway), they must have less than 50% health, there is only a 50% chance of it actually knocking, and it only tries once every 2 seconds (so using an MG with knock weapon is no more effective than using a RG)

** Reduced effectiveness of defensive abilities when upgrading out of your class

v2.166

** Restore movetype after V_Push()
** Completely revamped and improved monster AI which uses A* (a-star) pathfinding to find enemies/goals no matter where they are in a map. Monsters also have new commands which can be accessed with 'monster command'. Use this command while looking at a monster and it will be selected/deselected. Use it on a spot on the floor and monsters will move to that location. Use it quickly between two spots and monsters will patrol between the two locations.

==================
v4.8
==================
** Fixed AI bugs, made improvements to pathfinding
** Added flying monsters (flyer, floater, hover)!

==================
v5.1
==================
** Note: With fixes below, AI will use map navi entities in invasion if present, otherwise it will use A* pathfinding to reach a player spawn
** Forked vrxcl 5.0 codebase in late October '22 and began process of merging with changes made between ~4.7 (the basis of vrxcl) and 4.8, while retaining the improvements introduced by the vrxcl team
** Integrated substantial changes and improvements in drone_ai and related files that aim to keep monsters (drones) from getting lost
** Fixed bug in drone_findnavi() in invasion.c that caused monsters to return to the start of a navi chain after being interrupted, instead of finding the closest one
** Fixed bug in ComputeSuccessors() in grid.c that would break A* pathfinding by allowing the AI to use the cached_gridlist once populated. Note: This bug completely broke A* pathfinding in 5.0 (and was a PITA to find)!
** Fixed bugs in drone_misc.c with drone commands: move to spot, patrol, "follow me", "attack"
** Fixed bug that would cause monsters to forget their commands after losing their target (primarily affecting patrol)
** Fixed bug in NearestWaypointNum() in drone_ai.c causing monsters to get stuck due to the unreliable use of numpts as an indicator of the size of monster cached path lists (not sure if this makes pathnode[] unreliable for the same reason)
** Fixed bug in drone_ai_run1() in drone_ai.c that prevented monsters from (usually) re-calculating a path when their goal's position has changed
** Fixed bug in CanJumpDown() in drone_move.c that allowed monsters to fall even if the fall would place them off their intended path; this makes monsters follow their path more reliably (if a little erratically)
** Fixed bugs in M_AvoidObstruction() so that it actually works, i.e. it finds a path perpendicular to walls/obstructions when a monster gets stuck (doesn't help avoid monsters trying to fall, unfortunately)
